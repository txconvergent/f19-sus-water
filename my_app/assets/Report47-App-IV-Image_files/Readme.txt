Appendix VI. Global water footprint maps for selected crops (1996-2005)
The maps show the water footprints of crops on a spatial resolution level of 5 by 5 arc minute. The data shown
are averages over the period 1996-2005. The data are shown in mm/yr and have been calculated by dividing the
total water footprint per grid cell (in m3/yr) by the area of the grid cell.
